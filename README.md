## OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOP)
Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming pattern that includes or relies on the concept of classes and objects.  
It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes)  
which are used to create individual instances of objects.  

## Why OOP?
OOP makes code organized, reusable, and easy to maintain.  
Benefits of OOP include security: OOP prevents unwanted access to data, or exposing proprietary code through encapsulation and abstraction.

### Building blocks of OOP :
- classes
- objects
- methods
- attributes

#### Classes :
In a nutshell, they’re essentially user defined data types. Classes are where the programmer creates a blueprint for the structure of methods and attributes.  
Individual objects are instantiated, or created from this blueprint.

#### Objects :
Objects are instances of classes created with specific data.

#### Attributes :
Attributes are the information that is stored. Attributes are defined in the Class template.  
When objects are instantiated individual objects contain data stored in the Attributes field.  
The state of an object is defined by the data in the object’s attributes fields.

#### Methods
Methods represent behaviors. Methods perform actions; methods might return information about an object, or update an object’s data.  
The method’s code is defined in the class definition. When individual objects are instantiated, these objects can call the methods defined in the class.

## Four principles of OOP:

#### 1. Inheritance

Inheritance allows classes to inherit features of other classes. Put another way, parent classes extend attributes and behaviors to child classes.  
Inheritance supports reusability – if basic attributes and behaviors are defined in a parent class, child classes can be created extending the  
functionality of the parent class, and adding additional attributes and behaviors.

#### 2. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is containing all important information inside an object, and only exposing selected information to the outside world.  
Attributes and behaviors are defined by code inside the class template. Then, when an object is instantiated from the class, the data and methods  
are encapsulated in that object. Encapsulation hides the internal software code implementation inside a class, and hides internal data of inside objects.

#### 3. Abstraction
Abstraction means that the user interacts with only selected attributes and methods of an object. Abstraction uses simplified, high level tools, to access a complex object.  
Abstraction is using simple classes to represent complexity. Abstraction is an extension of encapsulation.

#### 4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism is designing objects to share behaviors. Using inheritance, objects can override shared parent behaviors, with specific child behaviors.  
Polymorphism allows the same method to execute different behaviors in two ways: method overriding and method overloading.
